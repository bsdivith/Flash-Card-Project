**Project Overview**
This project is a simple flashcard app built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. The app helps users learn new languages (currently supporting Spanish and French) by displaying a word in the foreign language and allowing users to flip the card to see the English translation. Users can also mark words they already know, and these words will be removed from the learning set.

**Features**
  1. Display foreign language words (Spanish and French) on flashcards.
  2. Users can flip the card to see the English translation.
  3. Users can mark known words, which are removed from the learning set.
  4. Cards flip automatically after 3 seconds.
  5. Saves progress by storing unknown words in a CSV file for future sessions.
